# Greedy algorithm does NOT always produce optimal solution
# It makes the locally optimal choice at each stage. Just like greedy people, they only consider the choice that seems to be the best at that moment.
# Shortfalls 
# 1. Most greedy algorithms fail to find the global optimal solution.
# 2. Hard to prove the correctness of a greedy algorithm.
